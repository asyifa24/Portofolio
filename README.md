# My Portofolio

[About Me](#)

Hi, my name is May.  Since the beginning of 2023 I have been studying and practicing to become a QA. I am happy to have finally found an area in which I can successfully develop myself. I hope that in the future I can become someone who professionally takes care of the quality of products and services.

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as a computer engineer. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have gained through courses and self-study. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also recently started learning test automation in JavaScript, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal â€” to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
